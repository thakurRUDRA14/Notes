## 🖥️ EC2 Servers – Elastic Compute Cloud

On AWS, virtual machines (VMs) are referred to as `EC2 Instances`.  
**EC2** stands for **Elastic Compute Cloud** (Version 2).

Here’s a quick breakdown of the terminology:

1. `Elastic` – Easily scale your server up or down (RAM, CPU, storage) based on demand.
2. `Compute` – Refers to processing power, i.e., virtual machines running your code and services.
3. `Cloud` – These servers are hosted remotely and accessible via the internet.
