# 🔐 Connecting to Your EC2 Instance via SSH

Once your instance is running, you can connect to it using your terminal.  
Open your terminal and Navigate to the folder where your key pair `.pem` file is stored.

## 1. Give SSH key permissions

Before connecting to your EC2 instance, set proper permissions for your `.pem` key:

```bash
chmod 700 your-key-name.pem
```

Replace `your-key-name.pem` with the name of your downloaded key file.

---

## 2. SSH into Your EC2 Instance

Use the following command to connect to your instance:

```bash
ssh -i your-key-name.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-public-dns
```

-   Replace `your-key-name.pem` with your actual key.
-   Replace `your-ec2-public-dns` with the **Public DNS** of your EC2 instance.

## 3. Clone Your GitHub Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

## You’re Live!

Visit your EC2's public IP (with correct port, e.g., `:3000`) in the browser to see your app.

> 🛡️ Make sure the **Security Group** allows inbound traffic on the port your app is using (e.g., 3000, 80, 443).
